This guide will provide the steps to enable an enterprise application, which does require administrative permissions. It will provide information on the permission required, adding the permissions for existing users, and enabling the application.

Depending on the application, there are two methods of enabling the integration:

* [Connect from the App Center](#connect-app). **Note**: Apps eligible for this type of connection utilize [OAuth 2.0 Company-Level Authorization](/api-reference/authentication/company-auth.html) and will have a Connect button displayed within the app listing.

* [Username and password](#name-password). If you do not see the Connect button, you will use this method.

To enable an app the:

* Concur App Center must be enabled for your company.
* User enabling the app must be an authorized SAP Concur Administrator. If you are unsure whether you are an SAP Concur Administrator, please refer to the section [Assigning Authorized SAP Concur Administrator Permissions](#permissions)

### Step 1: Confirm the App Center Is Enabled

Activating an enterprise application requires that your company has enabled the App Center. If the App Center is enabled, you will see the “App Center” tab when logged into SAP Concur.

### Step 1: Create & Transfer Credentials

> **Note**: This step can be completed by your own authorized SAP Concur Administrator. That individual must have the ability to authorize data sharing on behalf of your company. It is important that this Web Services Admin User Profile is not the same as any actual user of the system. **If an actual user’s credentials are utilized for this purpose and they leave the company, the applications will no longer function**.

The new WSAdmin User Profile in Concur Standard Edition should have the following attributes:

* **LoginID**: Include WSAdmin and the name of the application as the login id: WSAdmin-AppProviderName@YourCompanyDomain.com
* **First Name**: To easily identify this user profile later and also who the authorized user was that enabled the application, use a combination of “WSAdmin” and the first name of the administrator who is authorizing the application. Example: WSADMIN_John
* **Last Name**: Insert the last name of the authorized administrator who will enable the application.
* **Password**: Create a unique and secure password for the user.
* **Permissions**:
  * Select the **Can Administer or Travel and Expense Administrator** (depending on configuration) check box.
  * Select check boxes based on what type of data is needed for the application. The system will grant the relevant data access based on the roles that are assigned to this user. For example, if the app needs to access Travel data and the WSAdmin User Profile does not have access to travel, the app will not access travel data. Options include:
    * **Can Submit Expense Reports**
    * **Can Book Travel**
    * **Is Invoice AP User**

![Creating a WS Admin user in professional image](./guide-to-enabling-app-center-solutions-basic-create-ws-admin-user-professional.png)

The new WSAdmin User Profile in Concur Professional Edition should have the following attributes:

* **LoginID**: Include WSAdmin and the name of the application as the login id: WSAdmin-AppProviderName@YourCompanyDomain.com
* **Password**: Create a unique and secure password for the user.

![WS Admin user permission in professional image](./guide-to-enabling-app-center-solutions-basic-enable-ws-admin-professional-user-permission.png)

Next, while still in the **Administration** area, click **User Permissions**.

* Find the new WSAdmin User and select **Add** to grant **Web Services Administrator** permission.
* Ensure the WSAdmin profile also has the Expense User, Travel User, and Invoice User permissions or roles for apps integrating with Expense, Travel, and/or Invoice Services respectively. The system will grant the relevant data access based on the roles that are assigned to this user. For example, if the app needs to access Travel data and the WSAdmin User Profile does not have access to book travel, the app will not be able to access the necessary travel data.
* Once your new user profile has been created, transfer the login name and password securely to the app provider you are working with to create a secure data connection.

### Step 2: Enable the App

* The SAP Concur administrator who has been named in the newly created WSAdmin Profile logs into SAP Concur with the new credentials.
* Then go to **Administration > Company > Web Services > Enable Partner Application** and find the app.
* Click **Enable** and confirm the sharing of data.
